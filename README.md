# kfh_work

A Spring boot application for User/Accounts Rest API

I have used concepts such as Swagger, Caching, Developer tools, Profiles,Spring Security(to be implemented), JWT Authorization(to be implemented),  in this application

You can run it through an IDE like STS or Intellij or through maven:

Build the project using mvn clean install
Run using mvn spring-boot:run
The web application is accessible via localhost:8080
Swagger UI accessible at : http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
